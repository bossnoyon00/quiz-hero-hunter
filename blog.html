                            <strong>Map() :</strong>
                            The map() function receives a function as a parameter and will apply the code on each
                            element and returns an entirely new array. It will not change the original array.
                            A map() function returns a new array and thus it should only be used if you are going to use
                            the returned array else one should prefer forEach() function.
                            <strong>forEach() :</strong> The forEach() function receives a function as an argument and
                            it applies the same code to every element. It will not return anything, it just applies the
                            conditions to every element. It will not change the original array.

                            The return value of forEach() method is undefined. The forEach() method does not wait until
                            promises are resolved.
                            <strong>filter() :</strong> The filter() method receives function as a parameter. It runs
                            the function for each element in the array. It will return the new array which satisfies the
                            condition applied. It will not change the original array.
                            <strong>find() :</strong> The ES6 find() method returns the value of the first element that
                            passes a testing function. If no values satisfy the testing function, undefined is returned.
